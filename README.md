# CS-OpenGloves-Named-Pipe-Input-Library
A C# library I wrote to help send inputs to the OpenGloves driver for vr gloves/controllers

Huge thanks to these people:

danwillm - He helped a ton with formatting the InputData struct. I couldn't have done this without him so huge thanks.

L4rs - This library took heavy inspiration from his c# library for sending force feedback inputs to the glove via named pipes. I would have been very lost without him.
